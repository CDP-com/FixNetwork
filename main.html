			<p>To fix your network simply click on the Fix Network Button.
			You will see a command window flash. This is followed by a message
			to tell you if the reset was successful or failed. The message takes a few seconds
			to appear after the command window flash.</p>

			<p>Sometimes IP connections get messed up and you need to drop and renew it.  This is
			my first app so I would really appreciate some help on improving it.</p>

		<p>IPConfig is a command line tool that comes with your computer.  This is the tool we use to fix the your network when your IP address is

		<p>Programmers - Please help find a way to not have command window flash - Actually I think this could be much nicer with a working...
		graphic.  There are other Network tools that could be here as well.  </p>
